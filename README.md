# Just my Scuffed way to do an autoshot scroll on linux

sadly, I browsed a lot and couldn't find a way to make autoscrolling screenshot.

so this is my solution for now.

just download stuff get the dependencies and make in a venv and ~/bin source run and diactivate and have the tool with you in cli.


scuffed but it works to an extent :D... will try to improve when when I get good with this python
